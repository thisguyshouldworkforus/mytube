# MyTube

This project started out as a way for me to expand my `python3` knowledgebase. It started with the utilities [YouTube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube). However, I quickly found myself limited by these tools. Additionally, after YouTube changed the way channels were named (@ChannelName), [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) seemed to break. I'm not sure if this was the thing that broke it, but it forced me to start searching for an alternative, which is when I stumbled upon the aptly named [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix).

I started using this fork, but due largely to my ignorance with Python, and a feeling of intimidation, I paired the use of [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix) with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), a YouTube-DL fork.

I was using [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix) to read the channel or playlist, and putting desired results in an array, to be later processed by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). Redundant, I know.

Over time, I grew more confident, and thus worked myself up to doing everything with [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix), and re-encoding things with [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/).

### To my utter delight, it all works exactly as I would have hoped.

I'm still a beginner, and I humbly request any critiques you might have on how I can improve this project!

Thanks!
