### Details

I'm learning python, and as a great learning project, I decided to learn both [YouTube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/[YouTube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)) and [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube).

I found that [YouTube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) lacked some features that I found nessesary, like being able to filter videos based primarily on length but also on other criteria such as views and publish date.

I started to discover a lot about [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube), [YouTube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), as well as Python with this project and I'm having a lot of fun.

First and foremost, I'm still a beginner, and I'm learning more and more with every line of code.

I welcome any PR's and suggestions you might have, if you feel like contributing to this project.

Thanks!
